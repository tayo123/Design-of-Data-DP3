                <h2>The Silent Constituency</h2>
                <p>Can 20 million votes influence political action around climate change?</p>
                <p>This is exactly the question raised by the Environmental Voters Project, a non-profit whose research identified
                    this potentially game-changing group of registered voters who ranked climate and environmental issues
                    as one of the most important issues they will vote on. In the 2014 midterm elections, only 4 million
                    of these people voted.</p>
                <img style="width:100%" src="images/4_20.jpg">
                <p>If we are to believe that political change comes from starting small and voting locally, then these environmental
                    voters will decide the future of climate policy. Are we seeing some promising signs for the 2018 midterm
                    elections and beyond?</p>

                <h2>Marching for our Future</h2>

                <p>Protests give voice to the masses. They are a manifestation of grassroots activism and are fundamental to
                    our democracy. </p>
                <p>The first People’s Climate March took place in 2014 as a call to action, in response to the UN Climate Summit
                    taking place in New York City. While the estimated number of protestors varies, it was clear that there
                    was a critical mass of environmentalists - people who are willing to speak up and demand change from
                    their political leaders spreading anti-environment agendas.</p>

                <p>On April 29th, 2017 - one week after the March for Science - once again, the environmentalists flooded the
                    streets of Washington, D.C. and over 300 other major cities in the US and around the world. This time,
                    however, the atmosphere was that of resistance rather than solidarity.</p>

                <img style="width:100%" src="images/protesters.jpg">
                <p>The March coincided with Trump’s 100th day in office and it had very specific political decisions to rally
                    against including (but definitely not limited to) his appointment of climate science skeptic Scott Pruitt
                    to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, his signing of two executive orders approving the development
                    of the Keystone XL Pipeline by bypassing environmental regulations, and his intent to pull out of the
                    Paris Accord (a promise he has since fulfilled).</p>

                <p>In perfect symmetry to the Trump administration’s anti-climate actions, there is now a diverse group of activists
                    galvanized into taking their first steps.</p>

                <p>These marches were unprecedented, both in terms of their scale and the broad diversity of the protesters
                    who attended them. These marches are one of the many symptoms of a broken political system where the
                    upper echelons of our government are failing to meet the demands of its constituents.</p>
                <p>This is why we’re seeing cities and states stepping to the plate.</p>

                <h2>Climate FOMO: Cities & States Joining the Paris Accord</h2>

                <p>On November 6, 2018, Republican Bruce Rauner will seek re-election as Governor of Illinois, against the Democratic
                    candidate J.B. Pritzker, who tweeted:
                </p>
                <img class="center-block tweet" style="width:50%" src="images/tweet.png">
                <p>If Pritzker were to win, he’ll join the 17 Governors in the US Climate Alliance - a bipartisan coalition
                    of governors committed to the goals of the Paris Accord started by Governors Andrew Cuomo of New York,
                    Jay Inslee of Washington, and Jerry Brown of California on June 1st 2017, the same day that Trump announced
                    the U.S.’s exit from the Paris Accord.

                <p>The Alliance represents 40% of the US population and half of the US economic production at $9 trillion. Unsurprisingly,
                    states with higher emissions (controlling for GDP) are less likely to follow the Paris Accord. In response
                    to the inaction of their state governors, many mayors are signing up for the Accord. There are now 409
                    “Climate Mayors” who have also signed the Paris Accord by forming their own coalition that includes cities
                    from 48 states.</p>

                <h2>A View From the Top</h2>

                <p>Politicians stick religiously to their party line when it comes to environmental issues. This divide is clearly
                    reflected by the National Environmental Scorecard - the percentage of pro-environmental bills that the
                    politician supported - for the House of Representatives.</p>

                <p>Of the 35 environmental bills voted on in 2017, 124 Republicans scored zero (always voted against the environment)
                    while 84 Democrats scored a perfect score (always voting pro-environment), bringing the average score
                    for the House Republican caucus to 5% and the House Democratic caucus to 94%.
                </p>

                <p>A positive observation from this is the change of voting records in 2017. Compared to their average lifetime
                    score, the majority of Democrats leaned into their pro-environmental stance and more than a few Republicans
                    appeared to have positively changed theirs too. This is shown by the overall increase in the Environmental
                    Score, as shown by each point - representing a Congressperson - above the dotted line at 0%.</p>
                <img style="width:80%" class="center-block" src="images/Env_vote_score_change.png">
                <p>This change - galvanized, perhaps, by the actions of the Trump administration - is one that better reflects
                    the attitudes of local politics, as evident by the People’s Climate March and cities and states taking
                    up the Paris Accord.</p>

                <img style="width:80%" class="center-block" src="images/Critical_voters.png">

                <p>If we look at every congressperson from every state and political party and compare their Scorecard with
                    the number of environmentalists who did not vote in the 2014 midterm elections (as a percentage of their
                    state’s voter turnout), there is a lot of hope for the 2018 midterms. Many congressmen with the worst
                    environmental records are in states where the non-voting environmentalists represent over 20% of voter
                    turnout. </p>
                <p>At the individual level, recent surveys show that liberal democrats ranked global warming as the fourth most
                    important issue when deciding who to vote for in 2018 Congressional election and that even in the Trump
                    base, six out of every ten voters support taxing and/or regulating the pollution that causes global warming.
                </p>
                <p>These sentiments are reflected in the nationwide changes in climate perception between 2014 and 2016 on several
                    facets, as shown in the interactive graph below. Across the country, we see an increase in support for
                    funding renewable energy research and heightened levels of worry about global warming, amongst other
                    factors. This points to a positive swing in voters' minds about climate issues - one that we hope would
                    drive people to the polls. </p>

                <h2>November 6th, 2018</h2>

                <p>In the short-run, the true strength of the climate movement led by our environmental voters will be tested
                    by the upcoming midterm elections and continued support for the Climate Mayors and Governors who chose
                    to uphold the Paris Accord. We believe that there are activated voters who will lead the charge in the
                    long-run, and we are confident that change, as it has been, will start from the ground up.</p>

                <p>In the process of researching this story, we also uncovered data and narratives that present a highly partisan
                    view of climate policy-making. This raised an intriguingly open-ended question:
                </p>

                <p>What if, rather than candidates, we get to vote on issues that are dear to our hearts? What if we don’t have
                    to choose between Party and Policy?
                </p>

                <p>Perhaps then, we - the people, the politicians, the businesses - can really work together for our Planet A.</p>
