                <h2>The Silent Constituency</h2>
                <p>Can 20 million votes change influence political action around climate change?</p>
                <p>In a country of 325 million people, this may sounds like a silly question - yet this is exactly the question
                    raised by the Environmental Voters Project, a non-profit whose research identified this potentially game-changing
                    group of registered voters who ranked highly climate and environmental issues. In the 2014 midterm elections,
                    only 4 million of these environmental voters voted.</p>
                <p>If we are to believe that political change comes from starting small and voting locally, then these silent
                    environmental voters will decide the future of climate policy. Are we seeing some promising signs for
                    the 2018 midterm elections and beyond?</p>
                <p>We think so.</p>

                <h2>Marching for our Future</h2>

                <p>Protests give voice to the masses. They are a manifestation of grassroots activism and are fundamental to
                    our democracy.</p>
                <p>The first People’s Climate March took place in 2014 as a call to action, in response to the UN Climate Summit
                    taking place New York City. While the estimated number of protestors vary, it was clear that there was
                    a critical mass of environmentalists—defined in this story as people (voters) who rank highly environmental
                    and climate priorities—who are willing to speak up and demand change from their political leaders.</p>
                <img style="width:100%" src="images/protesters.jpg">
                <p>On April 29th, 2017—one weekend after the March for Science—once again, the environmentalists flooded the
                    streets of Washington, D.C. and over 300 other major cities in the US and around the world. This time,
                    however, the atmosphere was that of resistance rather than solidarity. </p>

                <p>The March coincided with Trump’s 100th day in office and it had very specific political decisions to rally
                    against including (but definitely not limited to) his appointment of climate science skeptic Scott Pruitt
                    to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, his signing of two executive orders approving the development
                    of the Keystone XL Pipeline and bypass environmental regulations, and at the time of the March, he intent
                    to pull out of the Paris Accord (Trump has since fulfilled that promise).</p>

                <p>In perfect symmetry to the administration’s largely anti-climate actions, we see a diverse group of activists
                    galvanized into taking their first steps alongside the old-timers.</p>

                <h2>Climate FOMO: Cities & States Joining the Paris Accord</h2>

                <p>On November 6, 2018, Republican Bruce Rauner will seek re-election as Governor of Illinois, against the Democratic
                    candidate J.B. Pritzker, who tweeted this:</p>
                <img class="center-block" style="width:50%" src="images/tweet.png">
                <p>Despite his signing of the Future Energy Jobs Bill to keep carbon-free nuclear plants operational and expand
                    the renewables portfolio standards and efficiency programs, Rauner did not put his name explicitly to
                    support the Paris Accord. That would be acting outside his party line. Clearly, there is a tension here
                    between doing what’s right for his constituents and what sticking to his political tribe. What’s interesting
                    to us is a small but significant symbolic meaning this action in light of the People’s Climate March.
                </p>

                <p>The message is clear: it is not enough for political leaders to show support for their constituents by talking
                    the talk, they must show solidarity by walking the walk.</p>
